Nature of Stateless Session EJB Part 2

#This tutorial shows that using stateless session EJB and teh same reference (fs in this case) 
#can be considered futile as the Bean it uses can be randomly chosen
#just because you think you have set locations and price using fs reference does not mean that you are using the same Bean 
#the information can be split across several Beans.
